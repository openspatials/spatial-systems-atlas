# Standards register

Prepared 2026-09-11. This replaces the **currency claims**, not the historical record, in the two standards documents dated 2025-10-31. Each row identifies the date on which its source was checked. Those dates are not a claim of a fresh September 11 standards census.

The retained evidence is the [August 20 freshness report](../../.dev/ai/subtask-comms/2026-08-20-standards-freshness-check-result.md), qualified by [VERIFIED-CORRECTIONS.md](VERIFIED-CORRECTIONS.md) and the accepted [September 9 primary-source register](../../.dev/ai/reports/2026-09-09-23-31-22Z-standards-review/source-register.md). The latter distinguishes normative text, drafts, catalog metadata and unread paid text. It takes precedence where the older report overreached, notably for C2PA, IEEE 2874 and VC companions. Source-scope tracing does not set Map scores.

| Subject | Version, status and date supported by retained evidence | Checked | Correction to the 2025 document / primary source |
|---|---|---|---|
| glTF | 2.0.1 specification, document dated 2021-10-11; registry identifies 2.0. Draft 2.1 is separate. | 2026-09-09 | Core status is usable. Audit extension status individually; do not inherit the old “ratified” list or an extension count. [Khronos registry](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/) |
| OpenXR | 1.1; all-extensions build read as 1.1.63. Core 1.1 ratified 2024-04-15; patch build is not a new core edition. | 2026-09-09 | Update patch context; an extension in the build is not necessarily core, ratified, or implemented by a runtime. [Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/html/xrspec.html) |
| WebGPU | Candidate Recommendation Draft, 2026-09-01. | 2026-09-09 | The old Working Draft label is wrong; final Recommendation is also wrong. [W3C publication](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) |
| WebXR | Device API Candidate Recommendation Draft, 2026-06-09; module maturity varies. | 2026-09-09 | Update draft date; keep browser support separate from specification status. [W3C publication](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) |
| DID | DID Core 1.0 Recommendation, 2022-07-19. The August report separately records 1.1 and Resolution candidate snapshots. | 2026-09-09 (Core); 2026-08-20 (successors) | Core is usable with method-specific limits; do not call the successor drafts final. [DID Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/did/) |
| Verifiable Credentials | Data Model 2.0 Recommendation, 2025-05-15. Bitstring Status List is also a Recommendation; JSON Schema remains CR Draft in the September read. | 2026-09-09 | The implementation-phase label is wrong. Do not promote every companion to Recommendation. [VC 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/), [JSON Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-json-schema/) |
| Web of Things | Architecture 1.1 and Thing Description 1.1 Recommendations, 2023-12-05; TD 2.0 FPWD, 2025-11-04. | 2026-08-20 | Keep the 1.1 claim; separate the TD draft from an assumed complete “WoT 2.0” suite. [Architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/), [TD](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/) |
| GeoPose | 1.0.0, approved OGC Implementation Standard 21-056r11; approved 2022-06-20, published 2023-09-08. | 2026-09-09 | “Draft, seeking uplift” is wrong. Publication and approval are different dates. [Normative document](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html) |
| 3D Tiles | 1.1 OGC Community Standard 22-025r4; approved 2022-12-17, published 2023-01-12. | 2026-09-09 | January 2025 adoption and “URL TBD” are wrong. The August report's 2.0 work is development, not this approved edition. [Normative document](https://docs.ogc.org/cs/22-025r4/22-025r4.html) |
| I3S | OGC 1.3, 17-014r9; approved 2022-12-12, published 2023-01-11. | 2026-08-20 | Add the version. OGC editions and Esri community/profile versions are distinct. [Normative document](https://docs.ogc.org/cs/17-014r9/17-014r9.html) |
| CityGML | 3.0 conceptual model: approved 2021-06-04, published 2021-09-13. GML encoding: approved 2023-05-10, published 2023-06-20. | 2026-08-20 | Both parts are adopted; I3S and 3D Tiles are not thereby CityGML encodings. [Part 1](https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-010/20-010.html), [Part 2](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-006r2/21-006r2.html) |
| SensorThings | Sensing 1.1: approved 2020-11-26, published 2021-08-04. WebSub extension 1.0: approved 2026-03-05, published 2026-05-04. | 2026-08-20 | Keep 1.1, add the separately published extension; the retained 2.0 vote outcome is unverified. [Sensing](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-088/18-088.html), [WebSub](https://docs.ogc.org/is/24-032r1/24-032r1.html) |
| IEEE 2888 family | 2888.1-2023 published 2024-01-08; 2888.3-2024 published 2025-01-30; 2888.5-2024 published 2024-10-01. | 2026-08-20 | Correct the .1 designation/date and .3 publication-vs-approval label. Physiological evaluation is P2888.5a, not the published .5 title. PAR approval is not publication. [IEEE .1](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2888.1/7676/), [.3](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2888.3/10470/), [.5](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2888.5/10787/) |
| IEEE 2874 | 2874-2025 board approval, 2025-05-28; September catalog carries active/approved-draft metadata. | 2026-09-09 | “D3.1, uncertain timeline” omits approval. Publication date and the approved normative body remain unverified/unread; do not infer their detailed behavior. [Catalog](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2874/11717/), [approval record](https://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/sba/28may2025/) |
| VRM | VRMC_vrm 1.0; release date 2022-09-22 retained from August; 1.0 normative sections reread September. | 2026-09-09 | “0.x” is wrong. VRM and Khronos avatar-extension progress are separate; the old completed-international-standardization claim is unsupported. [Specification](https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/tree/master/specification/VRMC_vrm-1.0) |
| USD / AOUSD | AOUSD Core 1.0.1 artifact, 2025-12-12. Implementation release numbers are a different axis. | 2026-09-09 | Add the omitted Core specification. Do not turn an announced ISO route or implementation release into ISO publication. [Core text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aousd/specifications-public/main/core/1.0.1/core_spec.md) |
| C2PA | Technical Specification 2.4, April 2026. | 2026-09-09 | Add provenance context, but withdraw the August report's blanket “no 3D support of any kind”: absence of a named 3D embedding profile does not erase general mechanisms. No 3D-specific soft-binding or implementation support was proven. [Specification](https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html) |
| MSF deliverables | WoW whitepaper dated 2026-03-31; Sneeze announcement 2026-06-15; domain-group consolidation observed August. | 2026-08-20 | The old group list needs updating. Publishing code, whitepapers and API proposals does **not** establish that MSF is a normative standards body. Membership and officer counts are omitted here. [Domain groups](https://metaverse-standards.org/domain-groups/), [WoW paper](https://webofworlds.github.io/initial_MSF_Whitepaper) |
| OMA3 / IWPS | Historical v0.3 draft, last substantive PDF replacement 2025-06-13; current mutable repository text read September. | 2026-09-09 | Keep draft maturity; distinguish a mutable document from a newly proven tagged v0.3 release. Approval/refusal is specified, adaptation sections remain TBD; no implementation test. [Base specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oma3dao/iwps-specification/main/IWPS%20Base%20Specification.md) |

Safe to retain with dates: established core editions such as glTF 2.0, OpenXR 1.1, DID Core 1.0, WoT 1.1 and SensorThings 1.1. Needs updating: omitted editions, separately versioned profiles, extensions and deliverables. Wrong claims to withdraw: GeoPose-as-draft; the 3D Tiles adoption date; VC 2.0's old phase; WebGPU-as-WD; VRM-as-0.x; the named IEEE designation/date/title errors; and unqualified glTF extension ratification. This is a correction list, not an adoption recommendation.

## Disposition of all 17 historical gaps

The old list is a set of 2025 research questions, **not seventeen empty cells in the current Map**. The [current capability export](../board/territory.json) has 162 capabilities in 14 groups at this check. The [accepted boundary implementation](../../.dev/ai/subtask-comms/2026-09-04-21-42-57Z-wo-064-boundaries-result.md) and [accepted capability expansion](../../.dev/ai/subtask-comms/2026-09-06-13-52-39Z-wo-071-capabilities-result.md) supersede the early overlay. No old gap warrants a new capability merely because its title differs.

The mapping below names questions, not support levels. [Current scope reports](../data/scope/) and the [September proposal review](../../.dev/ai/reports/2026-09-09-23-31-22Z-standards-review/proposal-review.md) qualify the sources. The [lab overlap table](STACK-OVERLAP.md) separates retained implementation receipts from documented scope.

| 2025 gap | Existing Map questions | Disposition and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-1 Federated presence | `net.presence`, `net.discovery`, `identity.social` | Retain cross-operator presence as a question. Local rosters and same-machine lab presence do not close it. |
| GAP-2 Asset ownership and transfer | `identity.credential`, `identity.rights`, `persist.inventory`, `net.handoff` | Separate ownership evidence, transfer, destination use and enforcement. No whole transfer system is accepted from their overlap. |
| GAP-3 Spatial identity and permissions | `identity.root`, `identity.exchange`, `identity.capability`, `avatar.identity` | Existing DID/VC/UM evidence reaches distinct parts. Do not call the whole area empty or infer interoperable destination policy. |
| GAP-4 Spatial audio | `audio.source`, `audio.spatial`, `audio.room`, `audio.occlusion` | Withdraw blanket absence. X3D and MPEG audio supply standards evidence; distinguish scene description from renderer/codec and current paid text from retained draft text. |
| GAP-5 Cross-world portaling | `net.address`, `net.session`, `net.handoff` | Existing WoW/IWPS/UM and lab evidence is partial and scoped. A local extension-assisted crossing is not whole-standard interoperability. |
| GAP-6 Avatar animation and behavior | `scene.animation`, `avatar.skeleton`, `avatar.retarget`, `logic.behaviour` | Existing X3D/H-Anim, VRM and glTF evidence supersedes blanket absence. Exchange, retargeting and execution remain separate. |
| GAP-7 Physics | `physics.rigid`, `physics.collision`, `physics.joint`, `physics.determinism` | Withdraw “no standard” and the failed glTF ratification forecast. X3D rigid-body definitions are existing standards evidence; equal simulation outcomes are another claim. |
| GAP-8 Procedural assets | `scene.geometry`, `render.material`, `logic.behaviour` | These cover adjacent results/execution, not a universal procedural recipe. Keep the residual distinction for the existing proposal process; no new row here. |
| GAP-9 Digital-twin state synchronization | `net.replication`, `net.time`, `persist.world` | X3D DIS contradicts blanket absence of standardized state sharing. It does not prove arbitrary digital-twin semantics agree. |
| GAP-10 Metaverse URI scheme | `net.address`, `net.discovery` | Existing HTTP(S)-based approaches make “needs a new scheme” an unproven requirement. Address syntax, resolution and navigation semantics differ. |
| GAP-11 Wearables | `avatar.wearable`, `avatar.skeleton`, `scene.licence` | Existing format/attachment evidence; fit, behavior and destination acceptance are not guaranteed by a wearable field. |
| GAP-12 Licensing metadata | `scene.licence`, `identity.rights`, `scene.provenance` | Metadata already exists. Keep enforcement and provenance separate; retract the empty-metadata claim. |
| GAP-13 Asset versioning | `deliver.version`, `persist.content-addr` | Existing revision/addressing mechanisms; no universal live-update or compatibility guarantee. Proposed dependency inventories remain distinct. |
| GAP-14 Accessibility | `persist.prefs`, `input.devcaps`, `render.text` (adjacent) | Partial questions only. These are not a complete accessibility contract. No new umbrella capability or closed-gap claim. |
| GAP-15 Carbon accounting | No dedicated capability | Retain outside the present Map comparison; IEEE project authorization alone does not supply a published accounting method. |
| GAP-16 Biometric integration | `input.eye`, `input.face`, `identity.privacy` (adjacent) | Tracking and disclosure do not constitute physiological evaluation. Leave that residual scope to an explicit product decision. |
| GAP-17 Sensory standards | `input.haptic`, `audio.spatial` (partial) | Existing haptic/audio questions do not cover every sense. Do not label the entire area empty or add a multisensory umbrella. |

**Overlay decision:** use the current atlas/matrix questions and their evidence drawers; retain this table as the historical crosswalk. No separate 17-gap overlay, renderer rebuild, score change or automatic proposal acceptance is warranted. The seven owner-parked rows in [ROADMAP.md](../model/ROADMAP.md) stay parked. Recommendations in later source reviews remain recommendations until their existing acceptance process admits them.

Next step: cite the dated row and current capability evidence for a statement; send any genuinely different capability through the existing owner-controlled proposal process.
