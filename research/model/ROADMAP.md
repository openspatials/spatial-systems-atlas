# Roadmap

Three lanes. **Now** runs without another word from the owner. **Next** needs one small decision each. **Later** is hard or long work; each item stays behind an owner gate with the gate's category and the evidence that it is real, and becomes a work order only on approval. Everything on the map's future is on this page; nothing is recorded anywhere else.

## Now — this week, no decision needed

| Id | Item | From | Scope | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Search box on every page | F1 | Type-ahead over capability names and definitions, subject names, group names; Enter jumps to the row, card or subject and highlights it; keyboard reachable; no library | Alfred's "transport protocol" query lands on Transport protocol in one keystroke sequence on all three pages |
| R2 | Plain labels: "Gaps — no system has it"; a terminology pass on every label, chip, eyebrow and legend key against plain meaning and the Forum's words | F3, F12 | Labels only; explanations follow the new words; the register is consulted for every changed term | A member who did not hear the talk reads every control without the explanation |
| R3 | Coverage metric on the header line | F7 | "Covered: N% built in · M% with extensions · P% with partial", with a selector for which subjects count: production only (status shipping, ratified, board-approved, mixed) or every subject switched on; one sentence under the number defining it; the same numbers on the atlas top level | The three percentages equal their queries under both selector positions |
| R4 | Comment button | F2 | A "Comment on this map" button that opens a prefilled email to the owner with the page and current location in the subject; a line saying comments are folded in every two weeks | Members can send a comment from any page in one click |
| R5 | Forum overlap routes on the atlas | F10 | Three named routes: "Web of Worlds with and without RP1", "Portals and handoff across the Forum's projects" (Inter-World Portaling System, Web of Worlds, RP1 Spatial Fabric, TeleportXR on Session handoff and portals and World addressing), "TeleportXR, alone and beside the standards" | Each route lands with the right subjects on and the right rows in view |
| R6 | "Layers" entry and layers-only view | F8 | A "Layers" link on every page to the atlas top level; on the atlas, a switch that hides the shores and shows the twelve regions alone | A newcomer reaches a twelve-box picture in one click from anywhere |
| R7 | Fortnightly maintenance pass | F2 | A standing order: every two weeks, read the comments received, fold accepted changes into the data, rebuild, republish, and post the change list on the page | First pass 2026-09-18 before the meeting |

## Next — one decision each, then it runs

| Id | Item | From | The decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | DONE 2026-09-04 (WO-060, deploy fa188a11). The atlas as the landing page at /msf/map/, matrix and C4 as modes behind it; retire /msf/map/c4/ with a redirect | F8, and the open C4 choice | Which of the three C4 attempts survives | Done as recommended: the atlas lands at /msf/map/; the matrix is one click away at /msf/map/matrix/; C4-in-page is the matrix's diagram mode at /msf/map/matrix/#mode=c4; /msf/map/c4/ returns 301 to /msf/map/; the map as it stood on 2026-09-04 is frozen at /msf/map/v1/ |
| N2 | Public comment list | F2 | Where comments live so everyone sees them: a public repository's issues, or a form and list served by the site itself (needs a store and a mail path on the hosting account), or email only for now | Email only now (R4); revisit after the first fortnightly pass shows the volume |
| N3 | Payments, entitlements and trust as capabilities | F11 | Scope expansion: about four new rows (machine and agent payments, entitlement and licence checks, payment identity binding, trust registries) scored across 35 subjects, one to two days of sourced research | Yes, after the 2026-09-14 X402 session so the rows use the Forum's own framing |
| N4 | Unreal Engine 6 statement | notes, "one thing said in the room" | Update the register with newer evidence, or send the chair a one-line correction | Send the correction unless newer evidence exists |

## Later — hard or long, behind an owner gate

Each item stays here until the owner approves it by number. Gate category and evidence are stated so the gate is real, not ceremony.

| Id | Item | From | Size | Gate category | Current evidence the gate is real |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Interoperability boundaries: a "must interoperate" flag per capability with its reason, derived from three or four lightweight use cases (move content between platforms; an avatar and its equipped items readable everywhere; AI movement solvers) | F5 | M, days | Scope and strategy: decides what the Forum tests and what it leaves alone; the working group should see the list | Grig 00:35:04: "defining those boundaries would help define where the tests are" — no boundary list exists in the data |
| L2 | Test framework design: two levels (functional per capability; pairwise interoperation), pass/fail definitions that a person cannot ignore, automated versus human, web runtimes first (GPU, CPU, time to first paint) | F5 | L, weeks | Scope and cost: multi-week effort with working-group participation | Don 00:22:53, Alfred 00:36:29; nothing exists yet; depends on L1 |
| L3 | Test results linked into the map: each cell can carry a result and a date; nightly runs | F5 | L, weeks | Depends on L2; needs a place to run tests | Don 00:20:36 |
| L4 | Per-subject scope tracing: every one of the 57 subjects traced to its full published scope so the capability list is complete and more gaps surface | F4 | L, days to weeks of research | Cost: the first pass was "about a week's worth of research" (Grig 00:18:34) | 6,882 claims today across 162 capabilities; the capability list has not been derived from the subjects' own scopes |
| L5 | Swappability and a stack advisor: which parts can be swapped and why; suggest a stack for a stated need | F6 | M to L | Data model change plus a new view; product judgement on recommendations | Grig 00:21:03; no attribute for this exists |
| L6 | OMB performance evidence: benchmarks for multi-layer rendering from many network locations against today's browsers | F9 | L | External dependency: OMB team, hardware, agreed method | Grig 00:28:27; the map records features, not speed |
| L7 | Certification concept note: levels from open-source-as-standard, through conformance tests, to a certification body and third-party labs; tests first, certification follows | F5 | S, one note | Low; kept behind the gate only because it is not map work | Alfred 00:33:48–00:39:13, Don 00:40:23 |
| L8 | OMB roadmap view: scope of work, versions, release candidates on a timeline | F9 | M | External dependency: the OMB team's own plan | Grig 00:25:36 |

Reply with the numbers to approve; each approved Later item becomes a work order and starts.


## Owner answers, 2026-09-04T21:42:57Z
- Addresses: today's map is frozen at /msf/map/v1/; the atlas becomes the landing page; the matrix stays one click away at /msf/map/matrix/; the separate C4 page redirects (WO-060).
- N1 approved as recommended (WO-060). N2: no email; a public GitHub repository whose issues show every submission, on the PeerMesh pattern (WO-061; the organisation is the owner's call). N3 approved, after 2026-09-14 (WO-063). N4: the owner is right that a first game is announced for version 6 (Rocket League, 2026-05-24); the register gains that fact with its dates; nothing runs on version 6 yet (WO-062). N5 withdrawn.
- L1 now (WO-064). L4 after breadth: a breadth order first (WO-067), then depth (WO-068). L7 reframed: no official certification; certification lanes built slowly, tests to follow (WO-065). Tests in general: one obvious example defines the pilot test set; steward's choice, avatar portability, for the owner to confirm (WO-066).
- All of these are written as orders and held; the owner dispatches them at a lower effort level.

## Owner answers, 2026-09-04T23:06:02Z
- Submissions: the organisation exists, https://github.com/openspatials/spatial-tech-map ; the comment button floats bottom right, a modal files the issue itself (title and body required, email optional and never published), the modal then points to the submission; the email link on the C4 page is replaced in that same update, not before (WO-061 rewritten).
- Pilot: avatar portability confirmed (WO-066).
- Breadth batch 1 replaced by the owner's list: AR support (Apple, Google, Niantic), Open AR Cloud, Verse and Fortnite with its editor, world models (NVIDIA Cosmos, World Labs Marble, Tencent Hunyuan World 2.0), volumetric capture (MPEG V3C/MIV, 4D Gaussian splatting and splat formats); new kinds and chip groups; lanes may propose new capabilities (WO-067). The earlier list becomes batch 2.

## Capability proposals from breadth batch 1, 2026-09-06T13:52:39Z
38 distinct proposals. Steward recommendation: take 28 (a Generation & capture group of 17, a World sensing group of 4, seven rows in existing groups), park 7 (capture.sensor-stream, capture.gen-job, render.scalability, scene.localisation, logic.transaction, logic.concurrency, logic.typecheck), fold persist.entitlement into the commerce order. WO-071 carries the exact list and the merges; it runs on the owner's go. Parked rows stay here for a later pass.
