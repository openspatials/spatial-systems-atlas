// The MSF Map data and counting model, ported from the accepted design candidate
// `design-candidate/MSF Map - redesign v3.dc.html` and its handoff notes.
//
// This module supersedes the earlier `data.ts` and `select.ts` pair, which belong
// to the interface the owner replaced. Both still drive the old shell and are left
// in place until the view port lands; nothing new should be built on them.
//
// Two rules from the design notes govern every line below.
//
// 1. Seven meanings stay distinct: built in, through an extension, partial,
//    absent, conflict, out of scope, and never assessed. A missing claim is NOT
//    "absent". Absent means somebody checked and it is not there. A missing key
//    means nobody has checked. Collapsing the two is the worst thing that can be
//    done to this dataset.
// 2. One definition per counted word. The old tool used "reach" three ways and
//    its numbers stopped being trustworthy.
//
// No React. Called once at load and memoised.

 * subject with few rows reached reads as one nobody has much to say about. When
 * most of the map does not apply, the low reach is a fact about the map's shape,
 * not about the subject, and the display has to say so.
 *
 * The rule: out-of-scope rows outnumber every other row, so more than half of all
 * capabilities sit outside this subject's kind. Below that line the subject is
 * measured mostly on rows that do apply, and the ordinary reading of its figures
 * is the right one. The threshold is a majority rather than a fitted number so a
 * reader can check it: count the rows, compare with half.

 * Never assessed is not out of scope and is not counted here. The two are
 * different facts and the dataset depends on that distinction holding.
