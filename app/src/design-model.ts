// The MSF Map data and counting model, ported from the accepted design candidate
// `design-candidate/MSF Map - redesign v3.dc.html` and its handoff notes.
//
// This module supersedes the earlier `data.ts` and `select.ts` pair, which belong
// to the interface that was replaced. Both still drive the old shell and are left
// in place until the view port lands; nothing new should be built on them.
//
// Two rules from the design notes govern every line below.
//
// 1. Seven meanings stay distinct: built in, through an extension, partial,
//    absent, conflict, out of scope, and never assessed. A missing claim is NOT
//    "absent". Absent means somebody checked and it is not there. A missing key
//    means nobody has checked. Collapsing the two is the worst thing that can be
//    done to this dataset.
// 2. One definition per counted word. The old tool used "reach" three ways and
//    its numbers stopped being trustworthy.
//
// No React. Called once at load and memoised.
