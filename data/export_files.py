"""Write the two download copies of the territory map: territory.csv and territory.md.

The CSV is the whole record, one row per claim, with the note and the sources.
The Markdown is the map as a reader sees it: one table per capability group, subjects
across the top, one symbol per cell, and every capability's binding word and definition
under its table.

Both files are built from `territory.db` alone. Run it twice on the same database and the
bytes are the same: the row order is fixed, the source order is fixed, and the build time
is read from the database file rather than from the clock.

Local evidence keeps its title and never its address, so no path from this machine reaches
either file. The script proves that before it writes.
