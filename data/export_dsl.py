"""Export the territory database as a C4 model written in Structurizr DSL.

One software system holds the open metaverse stack: its containers are the twelve capability
groups and its components are the eighty-nine capabilities. Every subject on the map is a
software system of its own, and every scored claim that reaches a capability is a relationship
from the subject to that component.

The file is written to infrastructure-wg/board/workspace.dsl. Output is deterministic: every
list is sorted, so two runs over the same database give byte-identical files. No path from this
machine reaches the file.

Read-only against territory.db. Writes exactly one file. Run it directly:
